# üìö Data Structures & Algorithms in JavaScript

Welcome to the **Data Structures & Algorithms in JavaScript** repository! This project is designed to help you understand and master the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms using JavaScript. Whether you're prepping for coding interviews, brushing up on computer science concepts, or simply want to deepen your understanding of how things work under the hood, this repo has got you covered.

## üìù Inspiration

This repository was inspired by [HuXn-WebDev/Data-Structures-Algorithms](https://github.com/HuXn-WebDev/Data-Structures-Algorithms). A special thanks to HuXn-WebDev for their amazing work in the field of data structures and algorithms, which motivated the creation of this project to further explore and practice these essential concepts in JavaScript.

## üöÄ What's Inside?

- **Data Structures:**

  - **Arrays**: Learn about dynamic arrays, array manipulation, and common operations.
  - **Linked Lists**: Explore singly and doubly linked lists, including traversal, insertion, and deletion.
  - **Stacks & Queues**: Understand LIFO and FIFO principles, and how these structures are implemented.
  - **Trees**: Dive into binary trees, binary search trees, and tree traversal techniques.
  - **Graphs**: Grasp graph theory fundamentals, graph representations, and graph traversal algorithms like BFS and DFS.
  - **Hash Tables**: Understand hash functions, collision resolution, and the efficiency of hash-based data structures.
  - **Heaps**: Get familiar with binary heaps and priority queues.

- **Algorithms:**
  - **Sorting Algorithms**: Master popular sorting techniques like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
  - **Searching Algorithms**: Implement and compare linear search, binary search, and other searching methods.
  - **Recursion**: Tackle problems using recursive techniques, understand the call stack, and avoid common pitfalls.
  - **Dynamic Programming**: Solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, and learn memoization techniques.
  - **Greedy Algorithms**: Implement algorithms that make local optimal choices, aiming for a global optimum.
  - **Graph Algorithms**: Explore algorithms like Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, and Floyd-Warshall for finding the shortest paths.
